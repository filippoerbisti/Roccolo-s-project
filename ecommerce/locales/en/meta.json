    "description": "Tenute Francesco Righetti in collaboration with Giuseppe Campagnola (two families who have collaborated together for generations), have created the Roccolo del Lago farm in the last 10 years, an estate located on the beautiful hills of Lake Garda. The company produces typical organic wines of the area: Chardonnay, Custoza, Bardolino, Corvina, Prosecco, Pinot Grigio, Valpolicella and Amarone. Winemaking is not the only focus as we propose ourselves as a location for events, weddings and organized tastings. We have both a physical shop on the estate and online where it is possible to order both the wines and the oil produced on the estate.",
