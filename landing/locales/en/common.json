    "historyTitle": "The history of the ancient Roccolo",
    "historyParagr1": "Built in the mid-19th century, the Roccolo is a small three-storey building originally used by hunters to catch migratory birds with their nets.",
    "historyParagr2": "This hunting technique was called Acupio, from the Latin Yaucupium, avis (bird) and capere (to take). Cages with decoy birds were placed on the plants. The nets were placed on the outer row of grove plants.",
    "historyParagr3": "The capture of birds was favored by the call coming from the cages that attracted migratory birds and by a special tool used by hunters, called scarecrow, which was launched causing noise in the grove. The alarm caused by the scarecrow pushed the birds towards the trapping nets.",

    "vineyardTitle": "The vineyards",
    "vineyardParagr1": "From these lands we select the best grapes for the production of Bardolino Classico and Chiaretto, fresh fruity wines that best represent the wine production of Lake Garda. Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara are born on moraine soils of glacial origin from vineyards that follow a free spurred cordon training system.",
    "vineyardParagr2": "Here, where Lake Garda regulates the climate of the area, mitigates it to ensure an average annual temperature of 15 Â° C, expert hands follow the cultivation of the vine with loving care and dedicate themselves to the production of quality wines.",
